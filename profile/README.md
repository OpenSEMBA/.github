OpenSEMBA is an open-soruce repository of codes for solving electromagnetic problems. It includes solvers based on FDTD, DGTD, MTLN, FEM and generate meshers. This repository is mainly developed and maintained by the [Group of Electromagnetism of Granada (GEG)](https://geg.ugr.es) from the [University of Granada (UGR)](https://www.ugr.es). Some of these solvers are included in the [Elemwave](https://www.elemwave.com) suite which provides a user-friendly interface.
